# Compiling and Running instructions:

Once in R studio open up "Shiny_App_Sweave.Rnw" , and when the code is present make sure that in the bottom right panel of r studio that the "Graphs" Folder is selected since the sweave needs all the pictures and graphs stored in that folder in order to run.
Once selected, on the top left panel of r studio click on the "Run" button then "Run All" and then to the left of the "Run" button click on "Compile PDF".
Enjoy!
