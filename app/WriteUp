US-Mexico boarder apprehensions have been steadily declining since 2000, and in April of 2017 they reached historic lows. These downward trends and record lows can be accredited to President Trump’s election. The data shows that President Trump’s aggression towards immigration laws is having a deterring effect, and migrants are less enticed to enter the country. DHS credits the administration policy as the lowest apprehensions prior to this past April were in December of 2011. This new low is 7,000 apprehensions less than the previous. In a year since April 2016, apprehensions were down 62%, though there are multiple different reasons for such a change.
