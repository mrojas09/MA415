## CNN Report Summary

US-Mexico boarder apprehensions have been steadily declining since 2000, and in April of 2017 they reached historic lows. These downward trends and record lows can be accredited to President Trump’s election. The data shows that President Trump’s aggression towards immigration laws is having a deterring effect, and migrants are less enticed to enter the country.

## Apprehension Summary Analysis

It is seen from the previous slide that Apprehensions throughout time have been slowly decreasing, and it is now as low as it once was back in the year 2011. This is being accredited to Donald Trumps aggression on border patrol and the desire to build a higher wall to prevent the US from having Mexicans or anybody fleeing their country to illegally cross the border into the states 

## Top 3 Month Periods with the most Apprehensions

Looking at the data and being able to manipulate and run a quick analysis on the apprehensions for both 2010 and 2017 we came up with the following conclusions for the most apprehensions in those years respectively by using the following R scrypt:
